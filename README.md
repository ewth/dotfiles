# Dotfiles
These are some funky dotfiles to pimp out your dev Mac and make life easier (and prettier).

## Setup

See `setup.sh` for how I've integrated the files into your terminal. You'll need to delete or rename existing files first, I won't comment on how you should do this as it depends on what you want to achieve.

In your terminal, visit Terminal -> Preferences -> Profiles and add `init/Ewan.terminal`. Set this as default and restart your terminal.

## Thanks
Most of these dotfiles have been passed around by developers with concepts borrowed from all over the show.
I copied this entirely from https://github.com/erfanimani and just made a few tweaks to suit my rig.
